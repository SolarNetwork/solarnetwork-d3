**Note** this repo has been superseded by
[sn-api-core-js](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/sn-api-core-js) and will no
longer be maintained.

# Building

You must have `npm` installed.

```sh
npm install # install dependencies
```

Then you can run

```sh
npm run build
```

to build the main JavaScript file, including a minified version. To build just the
full, non-minified version you can run

```sh
npm run build:dev
```
